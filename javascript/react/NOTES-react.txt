REACT
12/2019

- From the first page of Getting Started - an HTML file that works for prototyping and trying stuff out 
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/master/static/html/single-file-example.html

- Reminders of basic stuff 
  - import syntax 
      import theDefault from 'npmModule'
      import { aaa } from 'foo/bar'
      import * as bbb from './foo/bar'

  - Constructor (Different syntax from Java and Python)
      constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.myMethod = this.myMethod.bind(this);
        this.state = {foo: ''};
      }

  - CSS class attribute is className (common mistake)
  - Style looks like this 
      <div style={{color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold'}} />

  - Functions vs objects 
    - components are functions 
    - JSX html tags are objects (e.g. typeof React.createElement('div') == 'object')


- Forms
  - Controlled components vs uncontrolled components
    - Uncontrolled components - React *can* use refs and not use event handlers. Sometimes the right solution with 3rd party, non-React libs
  - Example 
      handleChange(event) {
        this.setState({value: event.target.value});
      }
      <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
  - Value vs defaultValue 
    - You probably want to use defaultValue
  - Formik 
    - Library to make forms easier 
    - "Build forms in React, without the tears."


- Context 
  - The consumer will use the default value (e.g. 'light' if no provider is an ancestor)
  - Values can be simple (e.g. a string) or complex, e.g. an object with props and methods { foo:'foo', bar:()=>{....} }
    - Reference identity is used to determine whether children need a refresh so...
    - Make sure they are defined some place in the code that won't be recreated on every render (e.g. contructor) or all the children will rerender constantly 
  - Example
      // theme-context.ts - should be in a separate file to avoid "ReferenceError: Cannot access context before initialization"
      export const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');   // default
      ThemeContext.displayName = 'xxxxxxxxxx';                    // Optional name for React dev tools 


      // Some component high up in the tree
      import { ThemeContext } from 'theme-context.ts';
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">                        // value
        ....
      </ThemeContext.Provider>


      // Some child component low down in the tree
      import { ThemeContext } from 'theme-context.ts';

      <ThemeContext.Consumer>{
        value => (
          ....
        )
      </ThemeContext.Consumer>


      // Or a less powerful syntax for a child that only works with classes and only allows one context, not multiple 
      static contextType = ThemeContext;
      {this.context}


- Forwarding Refs 
  - Sometimes you need access to the actual DOM element - e.g. focus, selection, or animations
  - Example 
      // Outer component 
      const ref = React.createRef();      // Will have ref directly to the inner component's DOM button *after* it has mounted and rendered
      <FancyButton ref={ref} />;

      // Inner component 
      const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
        <button ref={ref}>....</button>
      ));

- Refs 
  - Can't be used with functional components 
  - Refs can also be functions if you want more control 
      this.setTextInputRef = element => {
        // ... Do some stuff here
        this.textInput = element;
      };      

      <input
        type="text"
        ref={this.setTextInputRef}
      />


- Higher-Order Components (HOC)
  - It's a design pattern that uses composition 
  - HOCs are functions that take components and return another component 
    - HOC = (component) => anotherComponent
    - So it's not technically a component but it does return one 
  - HOCs are a type of Container Component 
  - Convention - named with camelCase, not PascalCase 
  - Example 

      withFoo(WrappedComponent) => {
        // Return a component 
        return Foo extends React.Component {
          constructor() {
            // Do some setup, add some life-cycle behaviors, etc 
          }

          // Add some props, wrap HTML, etc. 
          render() (
            <WrappedComponent {...props} addThisProp={addThisProp} />
          )
        }
      }

      BarWithFoo = withFoo(Bar);
      BazWithFoo = withFoo(Baz);

  - Redux Connect is an HOC 
  - Examples 
      // Redux 
      const ConnectedComment = connect(commentSelector, commentActions)(CommentList);

      // Relay
      const CommentWithRelay = Relay.createContainer(Comment, config);
  - Important 
    - Don't create HOCs inside a render method b/c the new function will always be different and cause lots of re-renders 
    - Refs aren’t passed through


- Render props 
  - It's a design pattern that uses composition 
  - It's a function that returns another component, but unlike an HOC, it's input might not be a component 
  - There's nothing magical about the name "render". You can pick something else. 
  - Important 
    - Using a render prop can negate the advantage that comes from using React.PureComponent


- Integrating with Other Libraries
  - Example with some jQuery plugin 
      class SomePlugin extends React.Component {
        componentDidMount() {
          this.$el = $(this.el);
          this.$el.somePlugin();
        }

        componentWillUnmount() {
          this.$el.somePlugin('destroy');
        }

        render() {
          return <div ref={el => this.el = el} />;
        }
      }


- Optimizing Performance
  - General 
    - For accurate numbers, make sure you are usign the prod build 
    - Make sure to turn off all Chrome plugins, especially React Dev tools
  - Virtualize long lists 
    - Use windowing if you dispaly 100s or 1000s of rows 
    - Helpful libraries - react-window, react-virtualized 
  - Avoid reconciliation and unnecessary DOM renders
    - Useful 
      - shouldComponentUpdate
      - React.PureComponent - equivalent to shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow comparison of current and previous props and state
    - Immutability 
      - Important - make sure you are always returning new arrays and objects rather than modifying them 
      - If you don't PureComponents with their shallow comparisons won't know to update 


- Portals
  - Useful for modals, pop ups, tooltips, etc 
  - Useful when you want an element that is not hidden by overflow or has the correct z-index 
  - In all other respects, it is a child of its React parent component 
    - Events bubble up through the React parent components, not necessarily through it's HTML DOM parents 


- Profiler API
  - Measures how often React is rendering and how costly it is 
  - Example - you can have one or more Profiler components, nested or not nested 
      <Profiler id="Foo" onRender={callback}>
        <Foo />
      </Profiler>
  - The callback method receives a lot of info and stats on what happened and how long it took 


- TypeScript
  - If an npm package or library does not have types, search on DefinitelyTyped - https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/
    - In rare instances, you might make your own local type declarations. More details - https://reactjs.org/docs/static-type-checking.html#type-definitions
  - There are lots of other rarer options for typed React projects - Flow, Reason, Kotlin 


- StrictMode 
  - A tool for highlighting potential problems before build 
      <React.StrictMode>
        ....
      </React.StrictMode>
  - Helps with:
    - Unsafe lifecycles
    - Legacy and deprecated code
    - Unexpected side effects
  - Important 
    - React does work in 2 phases - https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects
      - Render 
        - Determines what changes need to be made to the DOM
        - During this phase, React calls render and then compares the result to the previous render
        - Slower
      - Commit 
        - React applies any changes. (e.g. inserts, updates, and removes DOM nodes.) 
        - React also calls lifecycles like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate during this phase
        - Faster 
    - Lifecycles 
      - These might be called more than once or not at all so don't include side-effects
        - constructor
        - componentWillMount
        - componentWillReceiveProps
        - componentWillUpdate
        - getDerivedStateFromProps
        - shouldComponentUpdate
        - render
        - setState updater functions (the first argument)
      - StrictMode calls all of these twice in a row just to help you spot problems 


- React.Suspense
  - Only used for lazy loading of code. (Future plans to support data fetching)
  - See code splitting guide - https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy
  - Example 

      const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

      MyComponent = (props) => {
        return (
          // Displays <Spinner> until OtherComponent loads
          <React.Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
            <div>
              <OtherComponent />
            </div>
          </React.Suspense>
        );
      }


- Hooks 
  - Intro 
    - Reasons 
      - They give all sorts of reasons, but the main one is - hooks allow you to reuse methods that reference *state*
        - Especially useful if you want to share some logic that needs to go in a variety of places like componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
        - More powerful than HOCs and render props
      - Allows you to split code by concern rather than lifecycle
      - Classes are hard to minify and don't work as consistently with hot reloading 
      - It gives functional components features from classes without making them classes 
    - Can't use hooks with classes 
    - Requires you to stop thinking about lifecycles and more about declarative given this state what do I want to render 

  - A few thoughts on hooks 
    - Hooks are annoying at first but after a few days learning/experimenting, are actually mostly delightful 
    - Pros 
      - Does indeed result in less code, generally easier to read 
      - useContext and Redux's useSelector/useDispatch eliminate quite a lot of boilerplate 
      - Moving lots of related life-cycle code into one useEffect seems great, especially WET code in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate
      - Sharing stateful code between components seems great 
    - Cons 
      - useEffect 
        - It's dependency array seems really easy to mess up
        - Having an empty dependency array and returnign a function are not clear syntactical replacement for componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount
        - Seems wasteful to add and remove listeners/handlers/subscriptions every render 
        - Lifecycles were actually much easier to understand and were at least clearly named 
      - Classes seemed slightly easier to mock and test 
    - Misc thoughts
      - Yet another example where we have to relearn how to do everything over again, time we could spend learning backend, databases, machine-learning, etc 
      - The furniture gets moved around often enough (e.g. deprecated lifecycle methods, getDerivedStateFromProps) one always has to wonder if it's a fad 
      - I don't really buy a lot of the arguments for hooks. They should stick to their best arguments. 
        - "Classes are confusing" - They are not really. They are present in virtually every major current language 
        - "Fewer bugs" - Hooks seem to exchange known bugs for new bugs that are more subtle (e.g. useEffect's dependencies. Also useSelector needs shallowComparison for objects)
      - It's odd how dogmatic the community is 
        - They were so proud that "React is just a view library," but it's not anymore. It's beginning to have things like "useReducer". 
        - It used to be that classes were for "container components" and functions were for presentation. This seems more blury now with functional components doing everything 
        - "Functional programming, pure functions, etc", but with useEffect, functional components are no longer pure with always the same inputs->outputs 
      - Confusing names 
      - useRef - Sometimes used for DOM refs. Sometimes used to hold variables you want to persist across renders. 
      - useReducer - most people will probably assume this has something to do with Redux. Articles indicate it is not a good replacement for Redux in an app. 


  - useState 
    - [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue)
    - You can have as many useState()'s as you want 
      - Find a balance though. Use objects for logical groupings of objects 
    - Must be at top level of your function, i.e. not in loops or conditionals 
    - A setter can take a function. This is often useful in scenarios with timeouts or async 
        const [count, setcount] = setState(0);
        setTimeout(() => {
          setCount(count + 1);  // Will NOT always be accurate
          setCount(c => c + 1); // Will always be accurate
        }, 1000)

  - useEffect Hook
    - Used for side-effects - data fetching, subscriptions, manually changing the DOM 
    - Serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount
    - The useEffect and the clean up are run *after every render* unless you limit it with the second parameter's dependency array
    - The dependency array is really easy to screw up. Think very carefully about it
    - Example 
        useEffect(() => {
          // Do something....
          return () => { console.log('Run clean up code') };
        }, [foo, bar]); // Optional array. If values are the same, the array won't be run

    - Use as many useEffects as you like, usually organized by concept, not lifecycle

  - Rules 
    - Only call Hooks at the top level, not from loops, conditions, or nested functions
    - Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions
    - Plugin to help - eslint-plugin-react-hooks

  - Custom hooks 
    - Naming convention - useMyHookName
    - Each hook has isolates state so you can use the same hook/customHook as many times as you want in a component 

  - FAQ
    - Be careful with setTimeOut. It can reference old values because it can reference old variables
    - Another rule - if useEffect references a function, they want you to "declare functions needed by an effect inside of it"
      - Or you can move the function outside of your component to guarantee it doesn't reference any props or state 
    - How do I implement shouldComponentUpdate?
      - You can wrap a function component with React.memo to shallowly compare its props:
          const Button = React.memo((props) => {
            // your component
          });

  - Hooks API Reference 
    - useState
      - Lazy initial state
        - If the initial state is computationally expensive, do this 
            const [state, setState] = useState(() => {
              const initialState = someExpensiveComputation(props);
              return initialState;
            });

    - useContext 
      - This is actually much simpler than before 
          // Same as before 
          export const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
          <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
            ....
          </ThemeContext.Provider>

          // Different / simpler 
          const GrandChildComponent = (props) => {
            const value = useContext(ThemeContext);

            // Theme can now be accessed as "value"
          }

    - useReducer
      - Preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one
      - Community seems to agree it is not a replacement for Redux
        - You would need to use both useReducer and useContext and reinvent many things Redux does just fine 
        - Redux also allows great middleware like thunks and loggers 
        - Redux seems to be great for global state with many reducers. useReducer might be good for complex local state with one reducer 

    - useCallback
      - Returns a memoized callback. (Not exactly clear what the difference is between useCallback and useMemo)
      - useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps)
      - Example 
          const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
            doSomething(a, b);
          }, [a, b]);

    - useMemo
      - Returns a memoized value.
          const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);

    - useRef
      - Can be used like ref, to point to a DOM node 
          const Exampel = () => {
            const inputEl = useRef(null);
            const onButtonClick = () => { inputEl.current.focus(); };

            return (
              <div>
                <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
                <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
              </div>
            );
          }
      - Can also be used to store any mutable value over time. Similar to a class's fields 
      - Important 
        - Changing ref.current doesn't cause a rerender 
        - You aren't notified when current changes 

  - useImperativeHandle
    - useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, [deps])
    - Used with forwardRef

  - useLayoutEffect
    - Identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations
    - Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render

  - useDebugValue
    - useDebugValue(value)
    - Used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools
