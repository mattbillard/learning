- serve vs http-server
  - They seem mostly the same except
  -*** serve works with HTML5 history navigation and http-server does not 
  - https-server lists files and allows you to navigate folders like Apache servers do

- New project with TypeScript
    npx create-react-app APP_NAME --template typescript
- Templates 
  - You can find a list of available templates by searching for "cra-template-*" on npm.



With Parcel
- It is absurdly easy to use CRA + Parcel 
  - Use the official https://createapp.dev/parcel to make a new Parcel project 
  - Delete /src 
  - Also make a CRA project (optionally with TypeScript)
  - Copy /src and /public into the Parcel project 
  - Move /public/index.html to /src/index.html 
  - In /src/index.html...
    - Replace all: %PUBLIC_URL% -> ../public 
    - Add the script tag for the JS (or TS) before the </body>
        <script src="index.js"></script>
- Builds are far far far faster 
- Setting up CRA + Jest + Parcel takes a bit of extra work
