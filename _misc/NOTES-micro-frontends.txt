MICRO FRONTENDS 
2020-04
2020-12


SUMMARY 
- Goal
  - Multiple teams and many repos all creating 1 seamless UI/UX
- Challenge
  - How to do that without clobbering each other’s CSS, JS, cookies, localStorage, etc
- Quick history / context
  - Building apps has made the following progression over time 
    1) Monolith - Java (or other) + JavaScript in the same code base 
    2) Separate front end and backend 
    3) Microservices - split the backend into many services so each can be developed and deployed independently 
    4) Micro frontends - split the frontend into many micro apps so each can be developed and deployed independently 
- Possible solutions 
  - Old solutions 
    1) different app per page/section but they all import the same header/footer (super lazy solution)
    2) using iframes (each app is isolated from each other)
    3) Server-side rendering (not sure if this really counts)
    4) Different script tag per app. Routes are mapped to different apps. Going to a route calls a method to mount the app
    5) lazy loading different React bundle per page/section (Very little isolation from each other)
  - New solutions
    5) using custom elements to mix different teams' pieces into 1 experience (e.g. Spotify) (Minimal isolation from each other)
      - If you add in shadow DOMs, the CSS is very encapsulated and JS quite encapsulated
        - Note - experiments with shadow DOM indicate it is extemely difficult to target and work with DOM elements from JS inside the shadow DOM
        - This could cause lots of problems for 3rd party libraries 
  - Opinion
    - Best solutions 
      - Server-side rendering - if SEO matters the most to you (Not the case for the jobs I've worked at where apps are internal or behind a login)
      - Web components - best solution for a page made of multiple teams' work (e.g. Spotify, e-commerce site)
      - Iframes - best solution if apps absolutely must be isolated from each other 


Orthogonal concerns / choices as you architect your micro frontend 
- Same versus different UI framework 
  - All same 
  - Allow different - React, Vue, Svelte, Angular 
- Client vs server rendered
  - Client side rendering 
  - Server side rendering 
  - Both 
- Build deploy 
  - Separate
  - Together - recommended against building together as it gets slower and slower (https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911056)
- Routing vs jiggsaw/mosaic 
  - 1 page per app 
  - Multiple micro frontends on 1 page 
- Shared code 
  - Shared UI components, services, etc 
  - Completely separate (might provide for disjointed UI)
- Isolation vs porous
  - Very issolated - iframes (separate DOMs)
  - Some issolation - shadow DOM has issolated CSS 
  - No issolation - separate bundles (all in same DOM / runtime)
- Breaking up or joining together
  - Dividing 1 large app into many micro apps 
  - Bringing multiple existing apps into 1 "portal" (in which case you might be more flexible on different UI designs, architectures)
- Avoiding collisions 
  - Namespaces / prefixes by team, project, etc (e.g. for cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, global vars)
  - Encapsulation - React/etc components, IIFE
  - CSS - CSS modules, CSS-in-JS, nested CSS (e.g. with SASS), shadow DOM  
  - Iframes 


Iframes vs shadow DOM
- See experiments: /javascript/iframes-objects-shadowdom-etc 
- Iframe (very issolated/encapsulated)
  - Dimensions: determined by parent
  - Almost everything is issolated
    - JS can pass through if both are running on the same domain or use the same `document.domain = 'xxxxx';`
  - Shared vs issolated
    - CSS: issolated
    - URL: issolated
    - JS global vars: issolated
    - DOM selectors: issolated 
    - events: only window.postMessage
    - localStorage: only shared for same domain with same port
    - sessionStorage: only shared for same domain with same port
    - Cookies: shared? Needs more investigation
- Shadow DOM (very porous)
  - Dimensions: determined by child
  - Almost everything except CSS and HTML selectors are porous 
  - Shared vs issolated
    - CSS: issolated
    - URL: shared
    - JS global vars: shared
    - DOM selectors: issolated
    - events: shared (except they seem to come from the shadow root, not the actual target)
    - localStorage: shared
    - sessionStorage: shared
    - Cookies: shared
  - Sounds great in theory...
    - Does an incredible job isolating CSS very easily but...
    - JavaScript becomes very difficult
      - I have found no good way for JS in the shadow DOM to find its context, the equivalent of "window" for itself
      - This makes finding DOM nodes from inside a JS shadow DOM, extremely difficult
      - Comments from others indicate 3rd party libraries have problems because of stuff like this


- Note on web components 
  - "Web components" are several HTML5 technologies 
    - Custom Elements (custom HTML tags)
    - Shadow DOM 
    - HTML Templates (<template> tag)
    - HTML Imports (Deprecated. Not currently supported by any major browser.) 
  - Custom element !== shadow DOM, but they do work very nicely together 
    - Shadow DOM encapsulated CSS a lot and JS quite a lot 
    - Custom element makes it easy to for another app to "add one of these here"

Martin Fowler - Micro Frontends
https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html
- "An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole"
- Purpose 
  - Scaling frontend development 
  - Allow many teams can work simultaneously on a large and complex product
- History 
  - Monolithic backends -> microservices
  - Inspired frontend to do simlarly 
- Advantages
  - Maintainable 
    - Incremental upgrades
    - Can try new technologies in small doses 
    - Don't need to rewrite everything to add new technologies
    - Smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
  - Independent deployment
    - Should have separate CI/CD pipelines 
    - Easier to develop, test deploy 
    - Less risk when changing one app 
  - Autonomous teams
    - Scalable organizations
    - Teams organized around vertical business functionality rather than horizontal technical capabilities
    - Teams own a whole slice of customer value 
    - Teams can move quickly, flexibly, easily 
    - Teams don't conflict with each other 
  - User experience 
    - But still single, cohesive product / user-experience 
- Architectural considerations 
  - Need a container application 
    - Common components - header and footer 
    - Cross-cutting concerns - authentication and navigation
    - Lays out and composes micro apps 
  - Approaches 
    - Server-side template composition
      - Old fashioned, server side includes 
    - Build-time integration
      - List them as deps in a package.json 
      - Build them into one SPA 
      - Advantages 
        - Can de-dupe common deps 
        - Can enforce certain standards in the micro frontends 
          - Security / up-to-date packages
          - No global CSS 
      - Disadvantages 
        - Need to recompile and rerelease when any micro frontend changes 
        - aka "lockstep release process"
        - Ever larger build times 
    - iFrames 
      - A type of run-time integration 
      - Advantages 
        - Issolated styles and global vars 
      - Disadvantages 
        - Interaction between components is limited 
        - Routing, history, and especially deep-linking more complicated
        - Responsive design 
    - Run-time integration via JavaScript
      - Each micro frontend included as a script tag with a global function or component as an entry-point 
      - Container app determines which one to mount by calling its function or component 
      - Better still, only download the script tag if necessary 
      - This is his recommended approach 
      - Advantages
        - Each micro frontend can be deployed separately 
        - They can interact with each other 
      - Disadvantages 
        - Possibly duplicate deps across different micro frontends 
        - Each can affect the other (e.g. localStorage, cookies, etc)
      - Note - each micro frontend gets its own redux store 
  - Styling
    - Problem - teams that write global CSS will impact each other 
    - Potential solutions 
      - Naming conventions - e.g. BEM 
      - CSS pre-processing (e.g. SASS) + nested CSS 
      - CSS modules 
      - CSS-in-JS 
      - Shadow DOM - does a great job at encapsulating CSS 
  - Shared component libraries
    - Visual consistency and code reuse 
    - Usually better to build over time than try to plan and build something predicting all future needs 
  - Cross-application communication
    - Recommend having them communicate as little as possible reduce tight-coupling 
    - Send messages btw each other, not share state 
    - Solutions 
      - Custom JS events 
      - React style - pass data and callbacks down 
      - Use the address bar 
    - Changes can break contracts between apps so be careful 
      - Might require clear contracts and functional testing 
  - Backend 
    - See BFF - Backend For Frontend 
  - Testing
    - See Test Pyramid
    - Use functional testing to 
      - Ensure page is assembled correctly 
      - User journeys across apps 
  - Infrastructure
    - Each micro frontend gets its own 
      - Git repo 
      - Travis CI pipeline 
      - Amazon S3 bucket 
- Example 
  - The example is useful and good 
  - Noteable 
    - History is passed and shared between different React routers 
    - React and react-dom are marked as 'externals' in the webpack configs so they are shared across all 
- Downsides
  - Duplicate deps / payload size 
    - If you extract out common deps, the user doesn't need to download duplicate code 
    - However, you need to coordinate across multiple projects when upgrading common packages 
    - And in comparsion to assets like images, songs, movies, a few kbs of JS might not be worth agonizing over 
  - Environment differences
    - It simplifies local development to able to run a micro frontend both as part of the whole and as standalone
    - However, it makes it difficult to catch CSS conflicts 
  - Operational and governance complexity
    - More repos, pipelines, etc 
    - Requires more automation 
    - Goverance is more decentralized 
    - Frontends may become more inconsistent 


Micro Frontends
https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html
- NOTE: has some really great diagrams 
- Benefits
  - Incremental upgrades
    - Incrementally replace old code 
    - Try new technology 
    - New features developed rapidly without touching old code 
    - Upgrades can be one one-by-one instead of all at once 
  - Simple, decoupled codebases
    - Smaller code bases are easier to work with 
    - Firmer borders make it harder to have bad coupling 
    - Force you to be deliberate about how data and events flow between parts of the app 
  - Independent deployment
    - Smaller deployments = less risk 
    - Separate CI/CD pipelines that build and test each app separately 
    - Each app can go to prod at any time 
    - Another team breaking code should not impact your team 
  - Autonomous teams
    - Teams are arranged vertically around slices of functionality rather than capability 
    - Each team is full-stack and very independent of others 
- Integration approaches
  - Server-side template composition
    - This has been done for a long time
  - Build-time integration
    - Each app makes a package. The container pulls in all of them 
    - Pros 
      - Can deduplicate common deps 
    - Cons 
      - "lockstep release process"
      - If one app is changed, the whole thing needs to be rebuilt and released
      - Builds take longer and longer as more apps are added and they get larger 
  - Run-time integration via iframes
    - Pros 
      - Simple 
      - Issolated CSS and JS 
    - Cons 
      - Issolated = less flexible 
      - Difficult to interact = harder to do routing, history, deep links 
      - Responsive design 
  - Run-time integration via JavaScript
    - Different script tag per app. Routes are mapped to different apps. Going to a route calls a method to mount the app
    - Pros 
      - Each app is deployed separately 
    - Cons 
      - Same DOM = can affect each others' CSS, JS, and more 
  - Run-time integration via Web Components
    - Same as above but updated for HTML5 = uses custom elements
- Styling
  - CSS by default is global = each team can affect each other 
  - Solutions that have been tried
    - Strict naming (e.g. BEM)
    - Nested selectors (e.g. with SASS)
    - CSS modules 
    - CSS-in-JS 
    - Shadow DOM offers true CSS issolation 
- Cross-cutting concerns 
  - Shared component libraries
  - Cross-application communication
    - Recommedation: as little as possible to avoid tight coupling 
    - Choices 
      - Custom events 
      - Event bus 
      - "React style" pass props down, callbacks up 
      - URL address bar 
    - Not good choices 
      - Shared Redux - each should have a separate store so it can be a separate app 
      - Shared state - this is like a shared database/model = lots of coupling = hard to make changes 
  - Think long and hard about the coupling you're introducing 
    - How will you maintain the contract over time 
    - Tight coupling = hard to make changes = requires coordinated upgrades 
    - Integration tests - you'll need them 
  - Backend communication
    - Usually recommends each team be full stack, controlling both its front and backend code it needs 
    - Cross cutting concerns by login would be handled by a container team 
- Testing
  - Will need some extra functional and e2e tests to make sure different microfrontends are working well together 
- Example
  - The container
    - Container is create-react-app 
    - Routes map to different micro frontends 
  - The micro frontends
    - Each micro frontend lives on a different subdomain or port, downloads a JS bundle and renders itself 
    - CSS - uses CSS-in-JSS to encapsulate CSS (I think shadow DOM and  CSS modules are a better solution.)
  - Cross-application communication via routing
    - Router - router history is passed down to all micro frontends so they can navigate together 
  - Common content
    - UI components - they would all use the same UI component library
    - Bundle size - React and React DOM are split out as externals so they are not included in each app's bundle 
  - Infrastructure
    - Hosted on AWS (S3 buckets, CloudFront distributions, domains, certificates, etc)
    - Provisioned all at once using a centralised repository of Terraform code
    - Each micro frontend has its own repo, CI/CD pipeline, S3 bucket 
    - So they can be deployed independently 
- Downsides
  - Payload size
    - Common dependencies 
      - Repeated dependencies increases code downloaded but centralizing them makes apps more tightly coupled 
      - Remember though that micro frontends still load much faster than monoliths 
      - Also JS is small and fast in comparison to videos and slow database queries 
  - Environment differences
    - Usually each app can be run standalone versus together when deployed 
    - Makes development faster and easier but makes it hard to spot bugs from collisions in prod 
  - Operational and governance complexity
    - More apps -> more complexity, more infrastructure, pipelines, releases, etc 



Thought Radar 
https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/micro-frontends
https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=201911056
- Recommend against "front-end integration via artifact"
  - Usually pub to npm registry, pull all into one, and then build
  - However, any change to an artifact requires rebuilding whole thing
  - Slow 


Micro frontends—a microservice approach to front-end web development
https://medium.com/@tomsoderlund/micro-frontends-a-microservice-approach-to-front-end-web-development-f325ebdadc16
- Good introductory article 
- Approaches 
  - Single-SPA 
    - Allows you to combine Angular, React, Vue 
  - Multiple apps at different URLs but using npm packages for shared functionality / components 
  - Iframes 
    - Use window.postMessage to communicate 
  - Modules using a shared event bus 
    - (Not sure this is a complete appraoch. This is more of a method of communication.)
  - Varnish Cache
  - Web-components 
  - Blackbox React components 


The State of Micro Frontends
https://blog.bitsrc.io/state-of-micro-frontends-9c0c604ed13a
- Has best diagram explaining evolution of micro frontends 
- Why
  - Can develop, test, and deploy different parts of UI separately 
  - Add/remove parts of UI without a rebuild 
  - Use different technologies for different parts 
  - Decoupling 
  - Allows full-stack teams focused on parts of UI 
  - Easier for multiple teams to work together on one cohesive experience 
  - Faster developer speed 
- Approaches 
  - Client side 
  - Server side rendering 
- Helper libraries are needed 
  - Routing 
  - Communicating, event buses 
  - Sharing dependencies to minimize bundle size 


Ask HN: What do you use to build micro-front ends?
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13009285
- Iframes 
  - Cons 
    - Bundle size is larger b/c you can't extract common dependencies. (This is mitigated somewhat if users typically only look at 1 or 2 sections of the site per visit)
    - Can only have 2 levels of nested iframes (I confirmed this is not the case in Chrome. You can have up to 6 in some situations)
- React black boxes 
  - Cons 
    - Everyone needs to be on the same version of React 
    - Increased coupling 
- Different apps at different URLs. Use npm packages to share functionality 
- Web components 
  - Shadow DOM has a lot of potential

Building Microfrontends
https://medium.com/@_rchaves_/building-microfrontends-part-i-creating-small-apps-710d709b48b7
https://medium.com/@_rchaves_/building-microfrontends-part-ii-joining-apps-together-dfa1b6f17d3e
- This nomenclateur is good 
  - Page > App > Component 
  - Page - collection of apps 
  - App - something that can be run by itself 
  - Component - needs to be run in an app (e.g. date picker)
- Example 
  - A bit outdated at this point. Not a really good realworld SPA example 


The Strengths and Benefits of Micro Frontends
https://www.toptal.com/front-end/micro-frontends-strengths-benefits
- iframes 
  - Disadvantages
    - Multiple network calls 
    - CORS and code sharing between parents and children 






ASSESSMENT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS 
2020-12
- Honestly, not finding anything I love. 
  - Single SPA is by far the most popular of the frameworks I found 
  - All seem overly complicated 
  - Beginning to wonder if they really need to be a framework or if a rather simple library could suffice 


Single-SPA 
- Seems the most popular with 10x the number of npm downloads 
- Allows React, Vue, Angular, and more 
- Allows pieces of page to each be a separate micro frontend (e.g. the classic "tractor store" example)
- Based on routes?
- Wants you to write the container app in Vanilla-JS 
- Uses import maps 
- Communicate between micro-frontends using standard browser events 
- Allows for separate repos, builds, deployments, CI/CD 
- Micro-apps are registered with the root-app 
- Running the local version seems quite complicated with various over-rides and such 
- Seems popular, well documented, and well made... but quite complicated

- By SAP 
- Based on iframes and routes
- Uses SAP's UI "Fundamentals" UI framework 
- Seems very specific to their usecase 
- Not seeing a lot of features 
  - Navigation 
    - Register navigation items 
    - Change parent URL to allow Deep Links 
    - Programmatic navigation 
  - Register search

Ara Framework / Airbnb Hypernova
- Allows server-side rendering + client-side rendering in either React or Vue 
- Not really seeing any other features at all...


Piral 
- Allows React, Vue, Angular, and more 
- Allows pieces of page to each be a separate micro frontend (e.g. the classic "tractor store" example)
- Not sure if it allows server side rendering
- Seems kind of over-engineered with a multi-step CLI, build, and "feed" 
- You build different pieces, upload and register them to the "feed", and stich them all together with proprietary Piral code
