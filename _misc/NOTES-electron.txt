    - Easy desktop app development 
    - Code once, distribute everywhere - Windows, Mac, Linux

    - Saves time and money 
  - Use all the awesome open-source web software
  - There are many web devs so there's a large pool of developers
  - Node can access operating system 
- History
  - Created for Atom IDE. Supported by Github 
  - Electron was formerly known as Atom Shell
- Used to create 
  - Visual Studio Code, Atom, and more 
- Examples
  - https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
  - https://github.com/electron/electron-api-demos
  - https://github.com/electron/fiddle
- Development 
  - npm run dev - opens Electron app with Chrome debugger open 
  - Electron fiddle 
    - Easy way to try out tests with Electron 
    - Uses Electron Forge 
    - https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle
  - Electron Forge 
    - Combines best build tools 
    - Webpack, TypeScript 
  - The main process does not have Chrome Devtools
- Security 
  - Electron gives you more power than when you are only in the browser
  - Node can access the file system, shell, operating system, and more, so be careful 
  - So be especially careful what code you incorporate into your project (e.g. packages or other code)
  - Be more careful of the typical vulnerabilities of user input, injected content, eval, 3rd part script tags, cross-site-scripting, etc 
  - // Which raises the question why there isn't more security around VSCode plugins as it is an Electron app
  - Make sure to keep Electron and Node up-to-date to incorporate their latest security patches 
  - // Does OpenFin limit access to make Electron more secure?
  - They have great documentation on what not to allow and why 
  - Electron automatically approves all permission requests (e.g. notification, location, etc)
    - // Does OpenFin do this too 
  - // Content-Security-Policy can be set with an html meta tag 
  - By default, you can only use https 
- Electron Forge 
  - Seems to be the recommended tool to initialize a new project and build
