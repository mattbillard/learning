FETCH
- Fetch sucks. You have to reimplement tons of stuff: 
  - Status codes: if status >= 200 && status < 300, Promise.reject()
  - Data: you need to json.stringify(data) when sending
  - Content-type: you need to determine type when sending
  - CORS: Send request again after CORS OPTIONS request returns 
- Needs a polyfill for IE11 anyway
- Libs like Axios are tiny and solve all this for you

TYPESCRIPT
- Imports can sometimes be different, e.g. 
  -import React from 'react';
  +import * as React from 'react';
