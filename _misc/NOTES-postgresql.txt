LEARNED POSTGRESQL 
11/2019

- Install with Homebrew 
    brew install postgresql
  - Instructions the installer outputs
      To have launchd start postgresql now and restart at login:
      brew services start postgresql
      Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
      pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start


- Create DB and user 
    psql postgres
    drop database if exists testdb;
    create database testdb;
    create user myuser with encrypted password 'mypass';
    grant all privileges on database testdb to myuser;
    \l

- Dump the DB (Very useful for Flyway scripts)
    pg_dump testdb > ~/Desktop/pg_dump.sql


- PostgreSQL GUIs
  - PG Admin
    - version 3 
      - Used this one on a past project, but it's very outdated. Doesn't even support current version of PostgreSQL
    - version 4 
      - Far more features than v3
      - Too many features. Maybe good for power users, but seems a bit much for someone just starting out. 
      - Also rather annoying. Requires a master password. No button to test new DB conneciton. Just too many buttons and not very UX. 
        - pgAdmin password=password
  - *** Table Plus
    - Simple and very user-friendly. Easy to view, edit, and export tables and data. Great for getting started. 
    - Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite & more
    - Shows a log of your commands so you can learn
