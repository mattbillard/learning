MONO REPOS
9/2020

- "One Git repo per team", or even better "as few Git repos as possible to get the job done"

Advantages
- Easier to share code 
- Easier refactoring 
- Reliability
  - Because commits are made across multiple packages, you can reliably say all packages worked for each commit 
- Standardization / quality across multiple repos 
  - Easier to enforce same or latest deps 
- Easier to understand project end-to-end 
  - Smarter architecture decisions
  - Fewer bugs 
  - Less duplication 
- Publishing 
  - Avoid problems with cascading publishing
    - C needs to wait for release of B which needs to wait for release of A 
    - Bug in A might take a long time to show up in C 
  - npm link can get very complicated very quickly when one has multiple branches 
  - Can still be developed and deployed independently 
  - Less work - set up CI/CD once
- Easier integration tests 


Negatives 
- Difficult to limit developer access to parts of code 


Options
- npm trends

  - lerna is clear clear winner 
- Yarn workspaces
  - Low level. Helps install same dep across multiple parts of a project. Specifically not meant to compete with Lerna. Lerna actually uses Yarn workspaces 
- Bolt 
  - From the same people who made Lerna just not nearly as popular 
  - Advantage - structures things a little differently to ensure all packages use same deps 
- Bit 
  - Makes it easier to collaborate on UI components 
  - Notifies user teams when there are changes 
  - Requires hosting code in their hub

Lerna 
- Popularity 
  - About 10x more popular than Rush 
- Examples of monorepos 
  - Babel, React, Angular, Ember, Meteor, Jest
- Useful commands 
  - lerna init - create a new lerna repo or upgrade an existing repo
  - lerna bootstrap - installing all dependencies and linking any cross-dependencies
  - lerna import <pathToRepo> - import new package
  - lerna add - add a dependency to a package or link one to another 
  - lerna publish
  - lerna changed - check which packages have changed since the last release
  - lerna diff [package?] - diff all packages or a single package since the last release
  - lerna run [script] - run an npm script in each package that contains that script
  - lerna ls - list all of the public packages in the current Lerna repo.
- Instructions for new project 
  - npm install --global lerna@3
  - learna init 
  - git add . && commit -m "New lerna repo"
  - lerna import <pathToGitProject1>
  - lerna import <pathToGitProject2>
  - Add project2 to project1 
      cd packages/project2 
      lerna add project1
  - Change a file in project 2 to either import or require from project 1, e.g. 
      import project1 from 'project1'; 
      const project1 = require('project1');
  - In the root 
      lerna bootstrap 
  - It should install all the node_modules of all the packages and symlink package1 as packages/project2/node_modules/package1


Rush 
- Common commands 
  - build vs rebuild 
    - rush rebuild - does a full, clean build of every project in the repository
    - rush build - builds only the projects that have changed
    - rush rebuild --to <project>
    - rush rebuild --from <project>
  - rushx ____ - alias for `npm run ____`
  - rush check - checks if different projects are depending on different versions of a dep 
  - rush purge - remove all the temporary files created by Rush
- Advantages 
  - Parallel builds 
  - Uses pnpmp - downloads shared deps only once and symlinks them into each of your projects 
  - Enterprise policies - ensure same version of dep in all projects, approve new deps, review email addresses of contributors, 
- Gotchas
  - Adding packages 
    - Don't run the following or it will confuse Rush - npm install, npm update, npm link, npm dedupe
    - Commands 
      rush add --package example-lib
      rush add --package example-lib@1.2.3
      rush add --package example-lib@1.2.3 --make-consistent
- Misc 
  - Prettier - the Rush team seems to really like Prettier 


Lerna vs Rush 
- Lerna 
  - Much simpler 
  - 10x more popular 
  - Does NOT use pnpm - it downloads deps for each project separately = slower installs 
- Rush 
  - Much more complicated
    - Doesn't automatically detect packages 
    - It adds it's own .npmrc in common/config 
    - Doesn't use .npmrc to specify node version 
    - common/config 
    - common/git-hooks 
    - .travis-ci.yml (which you should just delete if you don't use Travis CI)
  - Uses pnpm - deps are only downloaded once even if all your packages require it
