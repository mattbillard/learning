POLYFILLS
9/2020

- There seem to be multiple great ways to not force all browsers to load all of Core-JS (or other polyfill)
  - https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/#loading-polyfills
  - https://philipwalton.com/articles/loading-polyfills-only-when-needed/

- Core-JS 
  - Including part of Core-JS is only slightly smaller than the whole thing b/c there's a large "core" set of code

  - So it seems like it might be simplest to just load all of Core-JS for older browsers and none for newest browsers rather than trying to pick individual small pieces
  - Core-JS does not include Fetch. Seems like Github's whatwg-fetch is popular

- Babel 
  - babel-polyfill has been deprecated
  - @babel/preset-env uses core-js

- polyfill.io
  - User's browser makes an XHR and gets just the polyfills it needs 
  - Sounds awesome and easy but it's a blocking script and therefore slows your site down
