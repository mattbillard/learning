- mrm
  - Manage all your dot files (e.g. .gitignore, .eslintrc, etc) in one place 
- node version managers 
  - nvm - for Mac/Linux 
  - nvm-windows - nvm for Windows 
  - nvs - might work on both Mac and Windows 
- npm-check-updates or npm-check 
  - Upgrades your package.json dependencies to the latest versions
- TypeDoc 
  - Generates documentation automatically from comments 
- Chat rooms 
  - Gitter 
  - Discord 
- ShellJS
  - Allows you to type out shell commands via node in Windows 
- CommonJS, AMD, UMD, ES Modules 
  - Fantastic and concise article outlining the differences
    https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm
  - CommonJS (aka require statements)
    - This is older. Node started with this but supports ESM with Node v13 
    - Browserify, RequireJS, SystemJS  - tools to enable code written for CommonJS to be used in the browser 
  - ESM (aka import statements) seems to be the clear winner
    - It is actually supported by most modern browsers and Node 
      https://caniuse.com/es6-module
  - CommonJS vs ESM 
    - https://medium.com/webpack/the-state-of-javascript-modules-4636d1774358
    - CommonJS is dynamic - require can change during runtime 
    - ESM is static - imports and exports cannot change at runtime. They are evaluated before the rest of the code. 
- .editorconfig 
  - Use this to make sure IDEs follow the official formatting for your project 
  - Seems like VSCode might need a plugin to support it 
  - Seems like Prettier could enforce a bunch of this (e.g. indentation)
- Yarn 
  - Article about why yarn is no longer necessary with recent npm improvements 
    https://iamturns.com/yarn-vs-npm-2018/
- Locale formatting 
  - JS has some built in methods to format numbers, currencies, dates, etc 
  - date.toLocaleString()
  - number.toLocaleString()
- Intl.RelativeTimeFormat()
  - Relative dates in words 
- Lighthouse 
  - Free tool from Google to assess your performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more
- Mermaid
  - Markdown -> UML diagrams 
- label
  - JS equivalent of goto statement. Could be useful to break out of a map or forEach 
- Sourcemaps 
  - Useful intro article 
    https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-source-maps
    - Comment at the bottom of the JS file tells the browser where to find the source map 
      //# sourceMappingURL=....
- .browserslistrc 
  - Convention - file where you list which browsers you'd like to support
  - Babel and other tools look here (or in package.json) to figure out what features need to be polyfilled, etc 
- CoffeeScript 
  - Seems like a predecessor to ES6 
  - Pros 
    - Syntactic sugar - classes, lambdas (Made obsolete by ES6)
    - Prevents bad code like global vars (Made obsolete by strict mode and later modular JS code)
  - Cons 
    - Slow compiler?
    - Difficult to map JS back to CoffeeScript to debug 
  - Was promoted by the Ruby community 
  - White space was important (e.g. like Python)
- Forward vs reverse proxies
  - https://smartproxy.com/blog/the-difference-between-a-reverse-proxy-and-a-forward-proxy
  - Forward proxy 
    - Between client and internet 
    - e.g. used by corporations to restrict internet traffic, hiding identity, avoiding firewalls 
  - Reverse proxy 
    - Between the server and clients 
    - e.g. used as load balancer, caching, single point of access to micro-service architecture 
- npm-run-all 
  - Useful for running multiple npm commands either sequentially or in parallel
