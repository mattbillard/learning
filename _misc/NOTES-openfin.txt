OPENFIN
7/2020

- Built on Chromium and Electron
- Features
  - Workspace management
    - Layouts, tabs, windows, snapshots (groups of windows)
  - Notifications 
    - Collects all OpenFin apps' notifications in a notification center 
  - Security 
    - Apps are sandboxed from OS and each other 
    - Administrators can control security - whitelist domain, control clipboard and ability to spawn processes 
    - Versus Electron 
      - OpenFin seems to be Electron + security (good configuration and some extras) + intended to be an ecosystem (e.g. workspaces, inter-app communication, etc)
      - Remove Node as an option in the renderer process
      - Prohibit exposure of any Electron API (private or public) to a third party app or website
      - Supposedly Electron disables parts of the Chromium sandbox that OpenFin fixes 
        - Ability to whitelist / blacklist certain domains 
        - OpenFin applies Chromium group policies to OpenFin. Electron supposedly does not.
