REACT - FORMS
2020-07

FORMIK
- Makes forms easier with React 
- Pros 
  - Reduces boilerplate for 
    - Initial values
    - Validate on blur and on submit
    - Show errors
    - isSubmitting
  - Clear validation logic
  - Standardizes your apps' approach to forms
- Cons 
  - Assumes you are workign with default HTML components
    - <Field> is not useful if you are using a UI toolkit with its own form components and form field wrappers
  - It's really designed for forms that are submitted
    - Not for form inputs that just change other componets in real tim
    - Example - a search that filters other components or filters on the left of an e-commerce site 
    - It's quite difficult to access the form values and change handlers outside the form component 
  - Doesn't handle showing/hiding dependent fields
    - Again, it's quite difficult to access the form values and change handlers outside the form 
    - For example - the onChange prop has no callback and does not return a promise, so can't change a value and then figure out which fields should be visible 

YUP
- Very useful library that makes form validation a breeze 
- Examples
    yup.string().email()
    yup.number().required().positive().integer()
