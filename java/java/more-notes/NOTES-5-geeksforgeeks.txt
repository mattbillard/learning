//- Skipping everything except a few interesting topics 

- Threads
  - Can either extend thread class or implement runable interface (better)
    class Demo1 extends Thread { 
      public void run() { 
        //...
      } 
    } 
    class Demo2 implements Runnable { 
      public void run() { 
        //...
      } 
    } 

//- Pages I read. Some I took notes on...

- File Handling in Java with CRUD operations

- Comparison of Exception Handling in C++ and Java
  - Java can't throw just anything. Must be of type throwable 

- Myth about the file name and class name in Java
  - Syntax to have 1 file with many classes. Good for experimenting
    /* File name: Test.java */

- Packages In Java

- Introduction to Spring Framework
  - JavaBeans helped develop web UI's but no services like transactions or security, so...
  - EJB (Enterprise Java Beans) but complicated and difficult, so...
  - Spring framework. 
    - Uses Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP), Plain Old Java Object (POJO), and dependency injection (DI)
    - Collection of sollection of sub-frameworks, aka layers, like Spring AOP, Spring Object-Relational Mapping (Spring ORM). Spring Web Flow, and Spring Web MVC
    //- Spring: the framework that was so complicated, it needed another framework (SpringBoot) to make it usable!

- Java Memory Management
